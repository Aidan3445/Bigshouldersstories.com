As an organization, we jumped on line as a team to connect and share stories, feelings, perspectives; to make sense of ourselves and the world around us. Suzy and technical producer Adam Yoffe teamed with ConTextos to structure and present ConTextos’ first cyber event: The Story Garden Party. At the peak of attendance, some 129 individual devices tuned in via Zoom to hear select stories from the hundreds that had been written up to that point. It was a glorious success for all. With the guidance of Big Shoulders Stories, what started as a rough idea, intended to celebrate the coming together of a disparate group of stories and storytellers, came to a most satisfying fruition.",

Suzy’s patience, understanding, feedback, support and allyship truly helped me understand how to successfully push past these mental barriers and write and speak with full truth and raw honesty.
